An integration test suite project that can be used for functional integration testing of SOAP webservice endpoints. It is built on top of http://testng.org/ TestNG testing framework, spring webservices (http://static.springsource.org/spring-ws/site/) project and uses http://code.google.com/p/jetlang/ Jetlang and http://groovy.codehaus.org/ Groovy.

Installation
Pre-requisites: Please have maven 3+ and http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts Spring source tool suite (or eclipse) installed. This project relies on the groovy-eclipse compiler in order to compile the code and not maven java or groovy compiler. If that is unviable please modify the pom accordingly. You also need to install the Groovy feature(including the optional 1.8 compiler) in STS/eclipse. If you are using plain vanilla eclipse, then M2Eclipse and EGit plugins need to be installed
apart from the groovy eclipse plugin.

Steps
git clone git@github.com:menacher/Test-Tools.git
cd Test-Tools
mvn eclipse:eclipse - Takes time!
eclipse -> file -> import -> git -> select repository and import
ws-int-test project in eclipse -> right click on pom.xml -> run as -> maven test - takes time!

If everything works as expected you should see some test cases executed successfully!

Happy coding!
